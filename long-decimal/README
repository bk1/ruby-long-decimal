Usage
-----

Just put longdecimal.rb in your path and add
load "longdecimal.rb"
to your ruby-file.  Please read the code to get an idea how to use this.

To test on Linux/Unix:
go into a directory long-decimal, put longdecimal.rb into a
sub-directory lib and testlongdecimal.rb into a sub-directory test.
This is the directory structure you get when unpacking the tar.gz
archive.  Then:

chmod +x test/testlongdecimal.rb

and run it:

./test/testlongdecimal.rb

You should not get any error nor any failure.  The tests will take a
minute or so, depending on the CPU-speed of your machine.
