Just put longdecimal.rb in your path and add
load "longdecimal.rb"
to your ruby-file.  Please read the code to get an idea how to use this.

To test on Linux/Unix:

do 
chmod +x testlongdecimal.rb
and run it
./testlongdecimal.rb

Licence
-------

Ruby's license or LGPL
Find copies of these licenses on http://www.gnu.org/ or http://www.ruby-lang.org/

Warranty
--------

This is a pre-alpha-version.  Do not expect too much!  This is work in progress!
I do not take any responsibility.  Please use it as it is, change it
according to the terms of the license or wait for a more stable
version (for wich I can't take any warranty either...)
